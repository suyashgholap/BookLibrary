# Library Management System

Title: Book Library Management System

Description:
This repository contains a Spring Boot application for managing a book library. The application provides RESTful endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books, authors, and book rentals.

Features:
1. **Book Management**: Allows users to add, view, update, and delete books in the library. Each book includes information such as title, author, ISBN, genre, and availability status.

2. **Author Management**: Provides functionalities to manage authors, including adding new authors, viewing author details, updating author information, and deleting authors from the system.

3. **Book Rental Management**: Supports booking and renting books from the library. Users can check out books, specify return dates, and manage their rented books.

4. **RESTful Endpoints**: All operations are accessible via RESTful APIs, making it easy to integrate the library management system with other applications or front-end frameworks.

5. **Data Persistence**: Utilizes Spring Data JPA for seamless integration with databases, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

6. **Swagger API Documentation**: Includes Swagger UI for easy exploration and testing of the RESTful APIs. The Swagger UI provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the endpoints and understand their usage.

7. **Exception Handling**: Implements robust exception handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful error messages to users.

8. **Security**: Implements basic authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the endpoints and restrict access to authorized users only.

9. **Unit Testing**: Includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application logic.

10. **Logging**: Utilizes logging frameworks like Log4j or Logback to maintain logs of application activities for monitoring and debugging purposes.

This repository serves as a foundation for building a robust and scalable book library management system using Spring Boot. Developers can easily fork, clone, and customize the application to meet their specific requirements and extend its functionalities as needed.
